# Implementation plan

Target: Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 2, North American PS2 SLUS-21441, running original game logic on Windows 10/11 x64. Build with Visual Studio 2022, MSVC, C++20, and CMake.

The first major gameplay goal is a playable versus battle. Use a custom compatibility runtime for only the PS2 behavior BT2 requires. PS2Recomp is a prospective recompilation dependency, Ghidra a prospective analysis tool, and PCSX2 a behavioral reference.

## Ordered steps and completion evidence

1. Native foundation: build and run `bt2-port`; document local content rules. Complete.
2. Local game validation: read the user's executable, check basic format and boot reference, and record size and SHA-256. Confirm the retail revision only against a trusted reference. Preliminary checks implemented; revision confirmation remains open.
3. ELF inspection: validate program/section table bounds and record entry point and load regions from the supplied file. Complete for local metadata; an empty load record's alignment anomaly remains documented. Keep raw reports in ignored `work/`. Do not infer function purposes.
4. PS2Recomp feasibility and integration: inspect upstream requirements and license, pin a revision, and establish a reproducible local generation pipeline with ignored proprietary-derived output.
5. Runtime entry: execute translated entry code with only the required compatibility calls. Record unsupported calls and evidence for each implementation.
6. First rendered frame, title screen, and main menu: incrementally implement the required graphics and platform behavior using observed results and PCSX2 as a behavioral reference.
7. Character selection and battle loading: validate required data access and gameplay transitions.
8. Playable versus battle: reach the first major gameplay goal with working controls.
9. Audio and a full match: verify sound, match completion, and return flow.

## Working rules

Keep game content in ignored `rom/` or `game_data/`, analysis output in ignored `work/` or `research/`, and proprietary-derived generated code in ignored `game/generated/`. Never download or commit proprietary content. Record confirmed facts, hypotheses, and unknowns separately. Preserve unknown function names until evidence supports renaming. Implement only PS2 behavior required by BT2.

Update `PROG.md`, the single progress log, after each verified step. Keep documentation under `docs/`. Review staged files before committing.
